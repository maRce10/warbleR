\title{Remove silence in wave files}
\usage{
rm_sil(path = NULL, min.sil.dur = 2, img = TRUE, it = "jpeg", flim = c(0, 12), 
flist = NULL, parallel = 1, pb = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located. 
If \code{NULL} (default) then the current working directory is used.}

\item{min.sil.dur}{Numeric. Controls the minimum duration of silence segments that would be removed.}

\item{img}{Logical argument. If \code{FALSE}, image files are not produced. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{it}{A character vector of length 1  giving the image type to be used. Currently only
"tiff" and "jpeg" are admitted. Default is "jpeg".}

\item{flim}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the highest and lowest 
frequency limits (kHz) of the spectrogram as in 
\code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is c(0,12). Ignored if `img = FALSE`.}

\item{flist}{character vector or factor indicating the subset of files that will be analyzed. If not provided
then all wave files in the working directory (or path) will be processed.}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control progress bar and messages. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Sound files for which silence segments have been removed are saved in the new 
folder "silence-removed_files". If `img = TRUE` then spectrogram images highlighting the silence segments 
that were removed are also saved.

\description{
\code{rm_sil} Removes silences in wave files
}
\details{
The function removes silence segments (i.e. segments with very low amplitude values) from wave files.
}
\examples{
{
# Set temporary working directory
# setwd(tempdir())

# save sound file examples
data(list = c("Phae.long1", "Phae.long2","lbh_selec_table"))
sil <- silence(samp.rate = 22500, duration = 3, xunit = "time")

wv1 <- pastew(pastew(Phae.long1, sil, f = 22500, output = "Wave"), 
Phae.long2, f = 22500, output = "Wave")

#check silence in between amplitude peaks
env(wv1)

 #save wave file
 writeWave(object = wv1, filename = "wv1.wav", extensible = FALSE)

#remove silence
rm_sil(flist = "wv1.wav", pb = FALSE)

# OR this if tempdir was used instead
# rm_sil(path = tempdir(), flist = "wv1.wav", pb = FALSE)

#check this floder
getwd()
