\title{Randomization test for singing coordination}
\usage{
coor.test(X, iterations = 1000, less.than.chance = TRUE, parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Data frame containing columns for singing event (sing.event),
individual (indiv), and start and end time of signal (start and end).}

\item{iterations}{number of iterations for shuffling and calculation of the expected number of overlaps. Default is 1000.}

\item{less.than.chance}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} the test evaluates whether overlaps occur less often than expected by chance.
If \code{FALSE} the opposite pattern is evaluted (whether overlaps occur more often than expected by chance).
Default is  \code{TRUE}.}

\item{parallel}{Either logical or numeric. Controls wehther parallel computing is applied.
If \code{TRUE} 2 cores are employed. If numeric, it specifies the number of cores to be used. Not available for windows OS.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the observed number of overlaps (obs.overlaps), mean number of overlaps expected by chance,
and p value.
}
\description{
\code{coor.test} Monte Carlo randomization test to assess the statistical significance of singing coordination
}
\details{
This function calculates the probability of finding and equal or lower number
(of higher if les.than.chance is \code{TRUE}) of song overlaps in a coordinated singing event.
The function shuffles the sequences of signals and silence-between-signals for both individuals to produce
a null distribution of expected number of overlaps by chance.  The observed number of overlaps is compared to this
expected values. The p-values are calculated as the proportion of random expected values that were lower (or higher)
than the observed value. The function runs one test for each singing event in the input data frame. The function
is equivalent to the "KeepGaps" methods described in Masco et al. 2015.

\examples{
\dontrun{
#load  simulated singing data (see data documentation)
data(coor.sing)

# testing if coordination happens less than expected by chance
coor.test(coor.sing, iterations = 1000, less.than.chance = T)

# testing if coordination happens more than expected by chance
coor.test(coor.sing, iterations = 1000, less.than.chance = F)
