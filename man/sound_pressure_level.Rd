\title{Measure relative sound pressure level}
\usage{
sound_pressure_level(X, reference = 20, parallel = 1, path = NULL, pb = TRUE,
type = "single", wl = 100, bp = NULL, remove.bgn = FALSE, mar = NULL, envelope = "abs")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{object of class 'selection_table', 'extended_selection_table' or any data frame with columns
for sound file name (sound.files), selection number (selec), and start and end time of signal
(start and end).}

\item{reference}{Numeric vector of length 1 indicating the pressure (in µPa) to be used as reference. Alternatively, a character vector with the name of a numeric column containing reference values for each row can be supplied. Default is 20 (µPa). NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing). It can also be
set globally using the 'parallel' option (see \code{\link{warbleR_options}}).}

\item{path}{Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located.
If \code{NULL} (default) then the current working directory is used. It can also be
set globally using the 'wav.path' option (see \code{\link{warbleR_options}}).}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control if progress bar is shown. Default is \code{TRUE}. It can also be
set globally using the 'pb' option (see \code{\link{warbleR_options}}).}

\item{type}{Character string controlling how SPL is measured: #' \itemize{
\item \code{single}: single SPL value obtained on the entire signal. Default.
\item \code{mean}: average of SPL values measured across the signal.
\item \code{peak}: maximum of several SPL values measured across the signal.
}}

\item{wl}{A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the spectrogram window length. Default is 512.}

\item{bp}{Numeric vector of length 2 giving the lower and upper limits of a frequency bandpass filter (in kHz). Alternatively, when set to 'freq.range', the function will use the 'bottom.freq' and 'top.freq' for each signal as the bandpass range. Default is \code{NULL} (no bandpass filter).}

\item{remove.bgn}{Logical argument to control if SPL from background noise is excluded from the measured signal SPL. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{mar}{numeric vector of length 1. Specifies the margins adjacent to
the start point of selection over which to measure background noise.}

\item{envelope}{Character string vector with the method to calculate amplitude envelopes (in which SPL is measured), as in \code{\link[seewave]{env}}. Must be either 'abs' (absolute envelope, default) or 'hil' (Hilbert transformation).}
}
\value{
The object supplied in 'X' with a new variable
with the sound pressure level values ('SPL' or 'peak.amplitude' column, see argument 'peak.amplitude') in decibels.
}
\description{
\code{sound_pressure_level} measures relative (uncalibrated) sound pressure level in signals referenced in a selection table.
}
\details{
Sound pressure level (SPL) is a logarithmic measure of the effective pressure of a sound relative to a reference, so it's a measure of sound intensity. SPL is measured as the root mean square of the amplitude vector, and as such is only a useful metric of the variation in loudness for signals within the same recording (or recorded with the same equipment and gain).

\examples{
{
  data(list = c("Phae.long1", "lbh_selec_table"))
  writeWave(Phae.long1, file.path(tempdir(), "Phae.long1.wav")) # save sound files

  spl <- sound_pressure_level(
    X = lbh_selec_table[grep("Phae.long1", lbh_selec_table$sound.files), ],
    parallel = 1, pb = TRUE, path = tempdir()
  )
