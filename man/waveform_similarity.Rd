\usage{
waveform_similarity(
  X = NULL,
  wl = 512,
  bp = "pairwise.freq.range",
  ovlp = 70,
  sim.method = "correlation",
  type = "standard",
  parallel = 1,
  path = NULL,
  pb = TRUE,
  n = 100,
  output = "square"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{'selection_table', 'extended_selection_table' or data frame containing columns for sound files (sound.files),
selection number (selec), and start and end time of signal (start and end).
All selections must have the same sampling rate.}

\item{wl}{A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the window length of the spectrogram, default
is 512. Only used when applying a bandpass filter (\code{bp != NULL}).}

\item{bp}{A numeric vector of length 2 for the lower and upper limits of a
frequency bandpass filter (in kHz). If columns for bottom and top frequency ('bottom.freq' and 'top.freq') are supplied "pairwise.freq.range" can be used (default). If so, the lowest values in 'bottom.freq'
and the highest values in 'top.freq' for the selections involved in a pairwise comparison will be used as bandpass limits.}

\item{ovlp}{Numeric vector of length 1 specifying the percentage of overlap between two
consecutive windows, as in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is 70. High values of overlap
slow down the function. Only used when applying a bandpass filter (\code{bp != NULL}).}

\item{sim.method}{A character string specifying the similarity method. Two option are available:
\itemize{
   \item \code{"correlation"}: calculates the Pearson correlation between the waveforms of the two signals. Higher values indicate higher similarity.
   \item \code{"DTW"}: calculates the Dynamic Time Warping distance between the waveforms of the two signals. Lower values indicate higher similarity.
   }}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the approach for estimating similarity. Two option are available:
\itemize{
   \item \code{"standard"}: estimates the similarity between the two waveforms with a single point estimate (e.g. the correlation or DTW distance between them). Default.
   \item \code{"sliding"}: estimates the similarity between the two waveforms by calculating the correlation or DTW distance at each "sliding" step of the spectrogram of the shortest selection over the longest one. This approach is more computationally intensive but might be more appropriate when comparing sounds with large differences in duration or when the appropriate alignment of the waveforms is hard to determine.
   }}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).}

\item{path}{Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located.
If \code{NULL} (default) then the current working directory is used.}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control progress bar. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{n}{Numeric. Number of values used to represent each waveform. Default is 100. Note that both waveforms are forced to have the same length which is done by interpolating amplitude values using the function \code{\link[stats:approxfun]{approx}}.}

\item{output}{A character string specifying the format of the output object with the estimated similarities. Two option are available:
\itemize{
   \item \code{"square"}: a matrix in which each cell contains the pairwise similarity for the items in the row and columns. This is a symmetric matrix as both triangles above and below the diagonal are identical. Default.
   \item \code{"rectangular"}: a data frame in which rows contain with the names of the two items being compared (1st and 2nd column) and the similarity value (3rd column). This is useful for plotting or subsetting the results.
   }}
}
\value{
The function returns a matrix (if \code{output = "square"}, default) or data frame (if \code{output = "rectangular"}) with the similarity for each pairwise comparison. The names of the items refer to the combination of the 'sound.files' and 'selec' columns in 'X'. The values in the matrix or in the third column of the data frame are the similarity values.
}
\description{
\code{waveform_similarity} estimates the similarity of two sound waveforms
}
\details{
This function calculates the pairwise similarity of multiple waveforms from annotations referenced in a selection table. Useful for the analysis of acoustic fine structure (e.g. Prior et al. 2018). Waveforms are forced to have the same length (see argument 'n'). This is done by interpolating amplitude values using the function \code{\link[stats:approxfun]{approx}}. The function can be used to compare waveforms using either the Pearson correlation coefficient or the Dynamic Time Warping distance. The latter is a measure of similarity between two sequences that may vary in the timing of occurrence of the changes in amplitude. 
Make sure all sound files have the same sampling rate (can be checked with \code{\link{check_sels}} or \code{\link{check_sound_files}}). Comparison can be done with a single point estimate (e.g. the correlation or DTW distance between them) or by calculating the correlation or DTW distance with a sliding window approach. This approach is more computationally intensive but might be more appropriate when comparing sounds with large differences in duration or when the appropriate alignment of the waveforms is hard to determine.
