\arguments{
\item{X}{Data frame with columns for sound file name (sound.files), selection number (selec), 
and start and end time of signal (start and end). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{flim}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the highest and lowest 
frequency limits (kHz) of the spectrogram, as in 
\code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is c(0,22).}

\item{nrow}{A numeric vector of length 1. Specifies number of rows. Default is 4.}

\item{ncol}{A numeric vector of length 1.  Specifies number of columns. Default is 3.}

\item{same.time.scale}{Logical. Controls if all spectrograms are in the same time scale 
(i.e. have the same duration).}

\item{collev}{A numeric vector of length 3. Specifies levels to partition the 
amplitude range of the spectrogram (in dB). The more levels the higher the
resolution of the spectrogram. Default is seq(-40, 0, 1). seq(-115, 0, 1) will produces spectrograms
similar to other acoustic analysis software packages.}

\item{ovlp}{Numeric vector of length 1 specifying \% of overlap between two 
consecutive windows, as in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is 50. High values of ovlp 
slow down the function but produce more accurate selection limits (when X is provided).}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).}

\item{mar}{Numeric vector of length 1. Specifies the margins adjacent to the start and end points of selections,
dealineating spectrogram limits. Default is 0.05.}

\item{prop.mar}{Numeric vector of length 1. Specifies the margins adjacent to the 
start and end points of selections as a proportion of the duration of the signal. If
provided 'mar' argument is ignored. Default is \code{NULL}. Useful when having high 
variation in signal duration.}

\item{lab.mar}{Numeric vector of length 1. Specifies the space allocated to labels and tags (the upper margin). Default is 1.}

\item{wl}{A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the window length of the spectrogram, default 
is 512.}

\item{gr}{Logical argument to add grid to spectrogram. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{pal}{Color palette function for spectrogram. Default is reverse.gray.colors.2. See 
\code{\link[seewave]{spectro}} for more palettes. Palettes as \code{\link[monitoR]{gray.2}} may work better when \code{fast.spec = TRUE}.}

\item{it}{A character vector of length 1 giving the image type to be used. Currently only
"tiff" and "jpeg" are admitted. Default is "jpeg".}

\item{path}{Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located. 
If \code{NULL} (default) then the current working directory is used.}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control progress bar. Default is \code{TRUE}. Note that progress bar is only used
when parallel = 1.}

\item{fast.spec}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then image function is used internally to create spectrograms, which substantially 
increases performance (much faster), although some options become unavailable, as collevels, and sc (amplitude scale).
This option is indicated for signals with high background noise levels. Palette colors \code{\link[monitoR]{gray.1}}, \code{\link[monitoR]{gray.2}}, 
\code{\link[monitoR]{gray.3}}, \code{\link[monitoR]{topo.1}} and \code{\link[monitoR]{rainbow.1}} (which should be imported from the package monitoR) seem
to work better with 'fast.spec' spectograms. Palette colors \code{\link[monitoR]{gray.1}}, \code{\link[monitoR]{gray.2}}, 
\code{\link[monitoR]{gray.3}} offer 
decreasing darkness levels. THIS IS STILL BEING TESTED.}

\item{res}{Numeric argument of length 1. Controls image resolution. Default is 100 (faster)
although 300 is recommended for publication/presentation quality. Note that high resolution
 produce significantly bigger image files. This could be problematic when creating pdf files
 using \code{\link{catalog}}.}

\item{orientation}{String. Indicates whether a letter page size image is produced in vertical ('v' option) or
horizontal orientation ('h' option). Note that width and height can also be specified.}

\item{labels}{String vector. Provides the column names that will be used as labels above the corresponding spectrograms.}

\item{height}{Numeric. Single value (in inches) indicating the height of the output image files. Default is 11 
for vertical orientation.}

\item{width}{Numeric. Single value (in inches) indicating the width of the output image files.  Default is 8.5
for vertical orientation.}

\item{tags}{String vector. Provides the column names that will be used for the color tagging legend above. Tags can also be numeric. Continuous variables would be break down in 10 color classes.
spectrograms.}

\item{tag.pal}{List of color palette function for tags. Should be of length 1, 2.  Default is \code{list(temp.colors, heat.colors, topo.colors)}.}

\item{legend}{A numeric vector of length 1 controling a legend for color tags is added.
Ignored if no tags are provided. Four values are allowed: 
\itemize{
   \item \code{0}: No label
   \item \code{1}: Label for the first color tag
   \item \code{2}: Label for the second color tag
   \item \code{3}: Labels both color tags
   }
 Default is 3. Currently no legend can be set for group tags. Use labels instead.}

\item{cex}{A numeric vector of length 1 giving the amount by which text 
(including labels and axis) should be magnified. Default is 1.}

\item{leg.wd}{Numeric. Controls the width of the legend column. Default is 1.}

\item{img.suffix}{A character vector of length 1 with a suffix (label) to add at the end of the names of 
image files. Default is \code{NULL} (no suffix). Useful to label catalogs from different individuals, 
species or sites.}

\item{img.prefix}{A character vector of length 1 with a prefix (label) to add at the beginning of the names of 
image files. Default is \code{NULL} (no prefix). Useful to label catalogs from different individuals, 
species or sites and ensure they will be grouped together when sorted by file name.}

\item{tag.widths}{A numeric vector of length 2 to control de relative width of the color tags (when 2 tags are provided).}

\item{hatching}{A numeric vector of length 1 controling cross-hatching is used for color tags. Several cross-hatching 
patterns are used to make tags with similar colors more distinguishable. Four values are allowed: 
\itemize{
   \item \code{0}: No cross-hatching
   \item \code{1}: Cross-hatching the first color tag
   \item \code{2}: Cross-hatching the second color tag
   \item \code{3}: Cross-hatching both color tags
   }}

\item{breaks}{Numeric vector of length 1 or 2 controling the number of intervals in which a 
numeric tag will be divided. The numbers control the first and second tags respectively. 
Ignored if tags are not numeric. Default is c(5, 5).}

\item{group.tag}{Character vector of length 1 indicating the column name to be used to color
the empty plot areas around the spectrograms. If provided selections that belong to the same
tag level are clumped together in the catalog (the 'X' data frame is sorted by that column).
This tags cannot be included in the legend so it would be better to use the label field to identify the different levels.}

\item{spec.mar}{Numeric vector of length 1 to add space at the top, left and right sides of
the spectrogram. Useful to better display the grouping of selections when 'group.tag' is 
provided. Internally applied for setting 'mar' using \code{\link[graphics]{par}}.}

\item{spec.bg}{Character vector of length 1 to control the background color of the spectrogram. Default is 'white'. Ignored if \code{group.tag = NULL}.}

\item{max.group.cols}{Numeric vector of length 1 indicating the number of different colors 
that will be used for group tags (see 'group.tag' argument). If provided (and the number is 
smaller than the number of levels in the 'group.tag' column) the colors will be recycled, 
athough ensuring that adjacent groups do not share the same color. Useful when the 
'group.tag' has many levels and the colors assigned become very similar. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{sub.legend}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then only the levels present on each
page are shown in the legend.}

\item{rm.axes}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} frequency and time axes are excluded.}

\item{title}{Character vector of length 1 to set the tile of catalogs.}

\item{by.row}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default) catalogs are filled by rows.}
}
\value{
Image files with spectrograms of whole sound files in the working directory. Multiple pages
can be returned, depending on the length of each sound file.
}
\description{
\code{catalog} produces spectrograms of selections (signals) split into multiple rows and columns.
}
\details{
This functions aims to simplify the visual exploration of multiple vocalizations. The function plots a
 matrix of spectrograms from a selection table. Spectrograms can be labeled or color tagged to facilitate
  exploring variation related to a parameter of interest (e.g. location, song type). A legend will be added to 
  help match colors with tag levels (if legend is > 0). Different color palettes can
  be used for each tag. Numeric tags are split in intervals (the number of intervals can be
   controlled with break argument). The width and height can also be adjusted to fit more column and/or rows.
  This files can be put together in a single pdf file with \code{\link{catalog2pdf}}.
  We recommend using low resolution (~60-100) and smaller dimensions (width & height < 10) if
  aiming to generate pdfs (otherwise pdfs could be pretty big).
