\title{A wrapper for tuneR's readWave that read sound files listed within selection tables}
\usage{
read_wave(X, index, from = X$start[index], to = X$end[index], channel = NULL,
header = FALSE, path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{'data.frame', 'selection_table' or 'extended_selection_table' containing columns for sound file name (sound.files),
selection number (selec), and start and end time of signals (start and end). Alternatively, the name of a '.wav' file or URL address to a '.wav' or '.mp3' file can be provided. The file name can contain the directory path.
'top.freq' and 'bottom.freq' columns are optional. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{index}{Index of the selection in 'X' that will be read. Ignored if 'X' is \code{NULL}.}

\item{from}{Where to start reading, in seconds. Default is \code{X$start[index]}.}

\item{to}{Where to stop reading, in seconds. Default is \code{X$end[index]}.  \code{Inf} can be used for reading the entire sound file (when 'X' is a sound file name),}

\item{channel}{Channel to be read from sound file (1 = left, 2 = right, or higher number for multichannel waves). If
\code{NULL} (default) or higher than the number of channels in a wave then the first channel is used. Only applies to '.wav' files in local directories.}

\item{header}{If \code{TRUE}, only the header information of the Wave object is returned, otherwise (the default) the whole Wave object.}

\item{path}{Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located.
If \code{NULL} (default) then the current working directory is used. If 'X' refers to a sound file including its directory 'path' is ignored.}
}
\value{
An object of class "Wave".
}
\description{
\code{read_wave} is a wrapper for tuneR's \code{\link[tuneR]{readWave}} function that read sound files listed in data frames and selection tables
}
\details{
The function is a wrapper for \code{\link[tuneR]{readWave}} that read sound files listed within selection tables. It
is also used internally by warbleR functions to read wave objects from extended selection tables (see \code{\link{selection_table}} for details).
}
\examples{
{
  # write wave files with lower case file extension
  data(list = c("Phae.long1"))
  writeWave(Phae.long1, file.path(tempdir(), "Phae.long1.wav"))

  # read from selection table
  read_wave(X = lbh_selec_table, index = 1, path = tempdir())

  # from extended selection table
  library(NatureSounds)
  read_wave(X = lbh.est, index = 1)

  # read WAV
  filepath <- system.file("extdata", "recording.wav", package = "bioacoustics")
  read_wave(filepath)

  # read MP3
  filepath <- system.file("extdata", "recording.mp3", package = "bioacoustics")
  read_wave(filepath)

  # URL file
  read_wave(X = "https://www.xeno-canto.org/513948/download")
