#' Example matrix listing selections to be compared by \code{\link{cross_correlation}}
#'
#' A character matrix with 2 columns indicating the selections to be compared (column 1 vs column 2) by \code{\link{cross_correlation}}. The first column contain the ID of the selection, which is given by combining the 'sound.files' and 'selec' columns of 'X', separated by '-' (i.e. \code{paste(X$sound.files, X$selec, sep = "-")}). The selection id's refer to those on the example data "lbh_selec_table". The second column refers to the sound files in which to search for the templates.
