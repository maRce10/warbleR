}
\arguments{
\item{X}{'selection_table', 'extended_selection_table' or any data frame with columns
for sound file name (sound.files), selection number (selec), and start and end time of signal
(start and end).}

\item{wl}{A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the window length of the spectrogram, default
is 512.}

\item{flim}{A numeric vector of length 2 for the frequency limit in kHz of
the spectrogram, as in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{wn}{Character vector of length 1 specifying window name. Default is
"hanning". See function \code{\link[seewave]{ftwindow}} for more options.}

\item{ovlp}{Numeric vector of length 1 specifying \% of overlap between two
consecutive windows, as in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is 70.}

\item{inner.mar}{Numeric vector with 4 elements, default is c(5,4,4,2).
Specifies number of lines in inner plot margins where axis labels fall,
with form c(bottom, left, top, right). See \code{\link[graphics]{par}}.}

\item{outer.mar}{Numeric vector with 4 elements, default is c(0,0,0,0).
Specifies number of lines in outer plot margins beyond axis labels, with
form c(bottom, left, top, right). See \code{\link[graphics]{par}}.}

\item{picsize}{Numeric argument of length 1, controls relative size of
spectrogram. Default is 1.}

\item{res}{Numeric argument of length 1 that controls image resolution.
Default is 100 (faster) although 300 - 400 is recommended for publication/
presentation quality.}

\item{cexlab}{Numeric vector of length 1 specifying relative size of axis
labels. See \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}.}

\item{title}{Logical argument to add a title to individual spectrograms.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{before}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} noise is only measured right before the signal (instead of before and after). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{eq.dur}{Logical. Controls whether the noise segment that is measured has the same duration
than the signal (if \code{TRUE}, default \code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE} then 'snrmar' argument is ignored.}

\item{propwidth}{Logical argument to scale the width of spectrogram
proportionally to duration of the selected call. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{xl}{Numeric vector of length 1, a constant by which to scale
spectrogram width if propwidth = \code{TRUE}. Default is 1.}

\item{osci}{Logical argument to add an oscillogram underneath spectrogram, as
in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{gr}{Logical argument to add grid to spectrogram. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{sc}{Logical argument to add amplitude scale to spectrogram, default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{mar}{Numeric vector of length 1. Specifies the margins adjacent to the
start and end points of the selections to define spectrogram limits. Default is 0.2. If snrmar
is larger than mar, then mar is set to be equal to snrmar.}

\item{snrmar}{Numeric vector of length 1. Specifies the margins adjacent to the start and end
points of the selections where noise will be measured. Default is 0.1.}

\item{it}{A character vector of length 1 giving the image type to be used. Currently only
"tiff" and "jpeg" are admitted. Default is "jpeg".}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).}

\item{path}{Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located.
If \code{NULL} (default) then the current working directory is used.}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control progress bar. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Spectrograms per selection marked with margins where background noise will be measured.
}
\description{
\code{snr_spectrograms} creates spectrograms to visualize margins over which background noise
will be measured by \code{\link{sig2noise}}.
}
\details{
This function can be used to test different margins to facilitate
  accurate SNR measurements when using \code{\link{sig2noise}} down the line.
  Setting margins for individual calls that have been previously clipped from
  larger files may take some optimization, as for calls within a
  larger file that are irregularly separated. Setting inner.mar to
  c(4,4.5,2,1) and outer.mar to c(4,2,2,1) works well when picsize = 2 or 3.
  Title font size, inner.mar and outer.mar (from \code{mar} and \code{oma} in \code{par}) don't work well
  when osci or sc = \code{TRUE}, this may take some optimization by the user.
